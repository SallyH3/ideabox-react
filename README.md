## Abstract:

As a solo practice project, I used React.js and leveraged Redux to create an app where users can store ideas; this is sort of like a to-do app but, geared more towards jotting something down really quick more than crossing items off of a list. 


## Setup:

First, clone down the repo.

```bash
git clone 
```

Once you have cloned the repo, install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```

To run tests, Run:
```bash
npm test
```
